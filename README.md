These are some games I made for fun while learning how to program using Visual Basic.

They were made when I was in grade 7 (2013) as side projects.

Unfortunately, the code was not saved. This repo only includes the .exe's.

I had made two versions for each game because they weren't compatible with different aspect ratios.
